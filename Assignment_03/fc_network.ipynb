    "The presented network is an adaptation of Michael Nielson's introductory example to neural networks. It is recommended, though not necessary, to read the first two chapters of his great online book ['Neural Networks and Deep Learning'](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) for a better understanding of the given example. Compared to the [original](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning/blob/master/src/network.py) by Nielsen, the present variant was vectorized and the sigmoid activation function replaced by a rectified linear unit function (ReLU). As a result, the code is written much more compact, and the optimization of the model is much more efficient. "
