    "Your main goal is to extend the existing framework, to perform experiments with different model combinations and to document your observations. Here is a list of necessary tasks and some ideas for additional points:\n",
    "  * (6) Write a data loader for a different image dataset, e.g., CIFAR or Labelled Faces in the Wild. Feel free to search a dataset you like to classify. Create and train a simple fully connected network on that dataset in this notebook.\n",
    "  * (10) Implement the `Conv` and `Pool` Layer in `layer.py`. Create and train a convolutional neural network on Mnist and your chosen dataset in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bonus points\n",
    "  * (5) 1 to 5 points are given for improving the class and method comments in the framework files. Points are given based on the quality and quantity of the comments.\n",
    "  * (1) For each additional implemented activation functions in `activation_func.py` you get 1 bonus point (max 4 points). Test your implementation in this notebook and observe effects on your networks. Keep an eye on your layer initialization.\n",
    "  * (2) Implement `Dropout` in `layer.py` and test your implementation with a toy example. Create and train a model that includes Dropout as a layer.\n",
    "  * (5) Implement `Batchnorm` in `layer.py` and test your implementation with a toy example. Create and train a model that includes Dropout as a layer.\n",
    "  * (4) Implement another optimization algorithm in `optimizer.py`. Train one of your models with that new optimizer.\n",
    "  * (5) Do something extra, up to 5 points.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Please document thoroughly and explain what you do in your experiments, so that work in the notebook is comprehensible, else no points are given."
